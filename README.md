# DroppersForFun
Keeping a place for quick shellcode loaders and other droppers for quick AV evasion. 

In test_cpp I embed shellcode using a resource file outlined in this <a href="https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/code-injection-process-injection/loading-and-executing-shellcode-from-portable-executable-resources">article<a>. Besides that it's a standard VirtualAlloc with RWX to get shellcode into memory. Will probably store variants here that are more stealthy and maybe with more functionality. 
  
Also need to make some for reflective dll loading and shellcode loading dotnet assemblies as well.
